# i3 config

My personal i3 tiling window manager configuration which I use on Lenova Yoga 7 (14 inch).

# Dependencies
- Kitty (Terminal)
- dunst (Notification)
- rofi (App launcher)

# Binds I often use
- ALT+(Number): move to workspace.
- ALT+Shift+(Number): move focused container (app) to specified workspace. I use i3 in tiling mode, so when i find too many applications on a single workspace, i can easily move to different workspace.
- ALT+F: full screen mode for the focused container. Because it is a tiling window manager, I find it useful to easily change the application to fullscreen.
- ALT+[hjkl]: change the current focused container similar to vim motion. I can easily change the focused app without mouse or trackpad.
- ALT+Shift+[hjkl]: move focused window.
- ALT: Show the status bar. To prevent burn-in on OLED display, I only bring it when necessary. Also, I don't really think status bar is quite necessary. So, I haven't really configured it.
- ALT+Space: Opens an app launcher. I intentionally put similar bind to Spotlight Search on Mac, though, it doesn't have search functionality in my files.
